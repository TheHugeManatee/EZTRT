# C++/CMake modern boilerplate
C++ template project for a cmake-based library/application project.

Shows some of the best practices I found/read about from other projects on how to start a project that is able to scale. 

partially based on https://github.com/Lectem/cpp-boilerplate for some cmake macro files.
